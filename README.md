## Introduction

GUI Turbo Assembler is an essential IDE for assembly language programming. It includes Borland Turbo Assembler (TASM), Turbo Linker, Turbo Debugger and DOSBox, making it a comprehensive solution for assembly development in both x86 and x64 environments.

GUI Turbo Assembler provides a rich set of features, encompassing fundamental file operations and advanced capabilities such as line numbering, syntax highlighting, code folding, docking, and theme personalization. The interface is highly adaptable, empowering users to modify the environment and configure default settings for Borland Turbo Assembler and Turbo Linker.

GUI Turbo Assembler supports localization in seven different languages and enables users to create and utilize their own localized files. Additionally, users have the opportunity to contribute those in the GitHub project. It also packs a terminal which allows user to take complete control of their programming.

This package comes with Borland Turbo Assembler 4.1, Borland Turbo Linker 7.1, Borland Turbo Debugger 5.0 and DOSBox 0.74-3

GUI Turbo Assembler is developed using Microsoft .NET Framework 4.0 and you should have it pre-installed. Microsoft .NET Framework 4.0 can be downloadable from the link given below

## Contribution

I would highly encounge you to contribute in the locale files. 

Currently localization is supported for French, Russian, Hindi, Polish, German and Chinese-Traditional. These localizations are computer genrated and not 100% accurate and I would kindly request you to contribute and/or correct the locale files. These are plain `JSON` files, which can be edited in any text-editor.

I would love to include the corrected as well as new version in the upcoming public releases.
