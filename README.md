## Introduction

GUI Turbo Assembler is an essential IDE for assembly language programming. It includes Borland Turbo Assembler (TASM), Turbo Linker, and DOSBox, making it a comprehensive solution for assembly development. 

Borland Turbo Assembler is a versatile multi-pass assembler compatible with Microsoft Macro Assembler (MASM) and supports a range of Intel 80x86 processors, including 8088, 8086, 80186, 80286, 80386, i486, Pentium, and Pentium Pro.

GUI Turbo Assembler works seamlessly in both x86 and x64 environments. For x64 compatibility, it emulates the required environment using a customized build of DOSBox, enabling the assembly, linking, and execution of code written in assembly language.

GUI Turbo Assembler offers a range of features, including basic file handling and advanced functionalities like line numbering, syntax highlighting, and code folding. The IDE is highly customizable, allowing users to tailor the interface and customize default arguments for Borland Turbo Assembler and Turbo Linker.

GUI Turbo Assembler supports localization in seven different languages and enables users to create and utilize their own localized files. Additionally, users have the opportunity to contribute those in the Github project.
