## Introduction

GUI Turbo Assembler is an essential IDE for assembly language programming. It includes Borland Turbo Assembler (TASM), Turbo Linker (TLINK), Turbo Debugger (TD) and DOSBox, making it a comprehensive solution for assembly development in both x86 and x64 environments. Both 16-bit and 32-bit mode of Turbo Assembler (TASM32), Linker (TLINK32) and Debugger (TD32) are supported.

GUI Turbo Assembler provides a rich set of features, encompassing fundamental file operations and advanced capabilities such as line numbering, syntax highlighting, code folding, docking, and theme personalization. The interface is highly adaptable, empowering users to modify the environment and configure default settings for Borland Turbo Assembler and Turbo Linker.

Additionally, users have the opportunity to contribute those in the GitHub project. It also packs a terminal which allows user to take complete control of their programming.

## Contribution

I would highly encounge you to contribute in the locale files. 

Currently localization is supported for French, Russian, Hindi, Polish, German and Chinese-Traditional. These localizations are computer genrated and not 100% accurate and I would kindly request you to contribute and/or correct the locale files. These are plain `JSON` files, which can be edited in any text-editor.

I would love to include the corrected as well as new version in the upcoming public releases.
