I would highly encounge you to contribute in the locale files.

Currently localization is supported for French, Russian, Hindi, Polish, German and Chinese-Traditional. These localizations are computer genrated and not 100% accurate and I would kindly request you to contribute and/or correct the locale files. These are plain JSON files, which can be edited in any text-editor.

I would love to include the corrected as well as new version in the upcoming public releases.
